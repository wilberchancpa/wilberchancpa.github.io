        <h4>Mediation and Arbitration</h4>
        <h5>Got into a dispute? Don't want to waste money and time in litigation?</h5>
        <p>Mediation is an effective means of dispute resolution for any dispute not requiring a judicial or third party determination. It provides a forum and an atmosphere in which parties gain understanding, become understood, and work together to explore options for resolution. It assists the parties to identify their needs and interests, and uses creative problem solving techniques to enable the parties to reach their own agreement.</p>
        <p>Arbitration is an alternative to litigation. In this process, the disputing parties present their case to a neutral third party who renders a decision. Arbitration is widely used to resolve disputes in both the private and public sector. It is a more efficient process than litigation because it is quicker, less expensive and far more flexible.</p>
        <p>Both Mediation and Arbitration are 100% confidential. More importantly, they save you the money, time and effort from going to court.</p>
