        <h4>Medical Bill Advocacy</h4>
        <p>The cost and complexity of health care continues to rise in the United States, and there is a trend of hospitals overcharging patients. Nowadays, it is not surprising to receive up to $10,000+ on your medical bill even when you have insurance. In addition to the stress of paying off the bill, medical bills can hurt your credit score when not handled in a timely manner. Doctors and hospitals don’t directly report debts to credit report agencies, but instead they turn their unpaid bills over to a debt collector. The debt collection agency reports the debt, and this can cause your credit to take a huge hit. In fact, just one collection account can cause a good credit score to drop 50 to 100 points. You don’t want that.</p>
        <p>The process of disputing with health care providers require significant amount of time, experience and knowledge. With that in mind, WChan Consulting LLC will ensure accurate medical billing on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Let us represent you in disputing your medical bills and negotiate with your service providers.</p>
        <p>No Cost to You Unless I Save You Money.</p>
